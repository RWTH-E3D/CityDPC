The [getting_started.py](getting_started.py) shows some basic import and export functions of the package and is a great place to start!

The folder [files](files) contains some example CityGML files you should be able to use any CityGML 1.0 or 2.0 file.

## getting_started
[This](getting_started.py) script shows you how you can load CityGML files to the package and perform some operations, like searching the dataset.

## PartyWall detection
[This](party_wall.py) script introduces you to the _check_for_party_walls_ function, which searches the loaded dataset for adjacent walls and displays them using a PySide6 GUI.
